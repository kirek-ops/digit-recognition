# digit-recognition

Simple Neural Network that tries to recognize a digit that you're drawing in the field. I used Tkinter for simple user interface, TensorFlow for NN implementation and OpenCV for image processing.

How to run:
Write in command line in terminal 
> python3 app.py

If you saved some feedback data and you want to refit model 
Write this in command line (and wait for refitting):
> python3 model.py
